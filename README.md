# Prerequisites - ngrok

[ngrok](http://ngrok.com) will setup the tunnels for incoming message from Webex Teams.
If not ngrok, you can use your own public reachable HTTP(s) URL.

You can find installation instructions here: [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)

1. After you've installed `ngrok`, in another window start the service. </br>
   Specify the region `--region=eu` for Europe or `--region=us` for US.
   
    ```
    ngrok http 7001 --region=eu 
    ```
**Note:** There are limits for users who don't have a ngrok account: tunnels can only stay open for a fixed period of time and consume a limited amount of bandwidth.

You can always restart your tunnel to reset the limits, or you can remove the limits by signing up for a free account.</br> 
After you sign up, be sure to connect your account's authtoken to the ngrok client.

2. You should see a screen that looks like this:

    ```
    ngrok by @inconshreveable                                                                                                   (Ctrl+C to quit)
